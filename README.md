## About
The page consumes data stored in 2 external **APIs**. The base *API* is located [here](https://botw-compendium.herokuapp.com/api/v2). We pull all the main content of the page from it. We use another **API** located [here](https://us-central1-involvement-api.cloudfunctions.net/capstoneApi) to store all interactions on the page, such as likes and comments.

We used **async** and **await** to handle all API calls. We compiled the project using Webpack.

The Kanban methodology was employed to work in this project, where each developer owned one main feature implementation.
### Features:
